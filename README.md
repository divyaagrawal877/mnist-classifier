# mnist-classifier
A program to classifier a digit from 0-9

We plot various instances of the dataset.
We then create a binary classifier using linear classification to classify a image as to whether it is a 5 or not a 5.
We perform cross validation to find various hyperparameters of the model and calculate precision/recall and plot ROC curve for this classifier.

We then use Support Vector Machine to perform multilevel classification to classify the instance from 0-9 category.
